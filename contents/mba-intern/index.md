### Field Study Opportunity with Koding & Greycroft Partners

Greycroft Partners is conducting a field project in conjunction with Koding, one of the firm's most exciting portfolio companies based out of Silicon Valley.  The field project would work well for 2nd year field studies and independent studies (3.0 units).  Please take a look at the following description and if you are interested contact Jason Yeh (MBA 2012) at jason@greycroft.com.  

### Project Description:

Koding has spent over 2 years heads down developing the most advanced, cloud-based, collaborative development environment on the market.  On August 7, 2013, Koding launched their platform publicly allowing their CEO to shift his focus away from technology development towards new strategic and customer acquisition initiatives.  This transition has brought on the first non-technical, business hires into the company with an eye on and expectation of explosive growth.

In conjunction with this shift in focus, Koding/Greycroft is hosting a field study for 2-3 business school students interested in gaining experience in strategy and operations for a high growth technology startup as it works through an array of strategic initiatives.  Students will work directly with the Koding CEO and executive team as well as investors from Greycroft to develop and execute plans around marketing, customer acquisition, and strategic partnerships.  This work will include market research, data analysis, customer research, and presentations to relevant stakeholders throughout the course of the semester.

In addition to regular check-ins with the Koding/Greycroft teams, students will be flown to the Koding offices for a kickoff meeting in September and a final presentation in November presentation.
