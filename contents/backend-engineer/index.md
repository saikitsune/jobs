# Help us build the development platform of the future!

Let's give people 100s of servers, 100s of people to work with, joy of building with amazing resources at the speed of light.

Let's make them say "goodbye localhost! it's been a good 20 years with you!"

## About you,

* You understand Computer Science concepts OOP, data structures and
algorithms - we don't care if it's LISP or Ruby you're good at. 

* Your code is poetry. Your audience reads it with joy.

* You love what you do. This is not a job to you, it's what you'd do anyway.

## Your technology stack should consist,

* Git inside out

* Continuous Integration tools

* NoSQL databases (Document Store, Search, Graph, KV Store)

* Messaging Systems (RabbitMQ and/or Ã˜MQ)

* Fluent in at least one programming language (Go & CoffeeScript are what we use the most)

* Good linux knowledge (I know you're not a sysadmin)

## Ok, sound good?

Then show us your poetry that rhymes with Go, Coffee, zmq, rmq - either you have projects using these, or you will make one and put it up.

Please send us your,

* Github repos

* Link to your blog if you have one.

Keep in mind, linkedin profile or your resume mean absolutely nothing to us.
