# Stability with 1 Million Users

You will help Koding keep humming and innovating while we reach 1 Million
Users. Yes, that's a lot of weight to put on your shoulders - but don't
worry you will be sharing the load with the rest of us.

## You promise,

* You know Linux inside out.

* You have done this before, at scale (10k concurrent users is a must).

* You can hack code to make things work when things go bad at 3am.

* You will be obsessed with availability and performance.

* You know how to find things that need doing when everything seems quiet.

### Bonus points available if,

* You know Ceph

* You know OpenStack

* You know LXC

* You know BGP

* You know Cisco IOS

* You know how to laugh

### Your profile

* You love what you do, so when you're not doing it for someone else, you're
doing it for yourself.

* You have been doing this for a few years *(more than 3)*

* You don't think of messing with servers and their associated stacks as a job.

* You are not afraid to use your voice when your stuck and ask for help.

* You try and at least RTFM before doing the above.

* You understand the need for documentation.

* You are based in San Francisco - or are happy to relocate.

## Ok, sound good?

This job could be described as DevOps, but it isn't because I hate that word.
So Systems Guru it is. Basically you will be helping keep the infrastructure
platform moving forward and "keeping it up".

To stand out from the noise tell me,

* Where you have done this sort of work before.

* What your favorite shell is and why.

* You best "I was in the datacenter at 3am when...." story

Sorry this isn't open to people with credentials but no experience. However if
you have lots of experience but no paper credentials - that's fine.
