# Reaching 1 Million Users

You are to help Koding each 1 Million Users. Yes, that's your assignment.
If you accept, read on.

## You promise,

* You can make Koding grow with the most creative hacking abilities,
without spamming.

* You will make sure that you're not only getting new users, but that you're
also improving the platform so that they are happy to stay.

* You can hack things, write small scripts or work with people who can.

* You know who your audience is because you are/were one of them.

* You have necessary connections to pull strings.

* Your network is awesome, you know people at Google, Facebook, Techcrunch
and other relevant places.

* You know where should we be promoted and how - you can make it happen.

* You know partnering up with HP is so 90's, supporting .NET is not the best
idea, Coldfusion is history.

* You will suggest meaningful UX - so that we can convert better.

* You will manage community.

* You will find ways to increase traction, analyze cohorts - be on top of
Mixpanel.

## Your profile

* You find growth strategies that are scalable and repeatable.

* Your methods are driven by product and inspired by data.

* You can write code.

* You can write blog posts.

* You can say "fuck this shit" in public ([see Zed Shaw - he's awesome](https://vimeo.com/43380467)).

* You can look beyond adwords or SEO.

* You know why we exist, craft viral strategies easy.

* You are ethical, you don't make fake twitter followers, nor increase
user counts just to make yourself look better.

* You can fire yourself if you are not performing well.

* You know who Noah Kagan, Andrew Chen are, you can do what they did.

## Ok, sound good?

This job is not for everyone. If you don't hear from me it's because
I get a lot of emails and  saying "Sorry" shouldn't be necessary.

However, if you do want to hear back, tell me:

* One or two ideas that convinces me that you can deliver

* If you have done this before, let me know what you did

Short emails work the best. Your links should tell your story, not your email.

Reach me at my name at koding dot com.
