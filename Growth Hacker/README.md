* You know who your audience is because you are/were one of them

* You have necessary connections to pull strings

* Your network is awesome, you know people at Google, Facebook, Techcrunch and other relevant places

* You know where should we be promoted and how - you can make it happen

* You know partnering up with HP is so 90's, supporting .NET is not the best idea, Coldfusion is history

* You will suggest meaningful UX - so that we can convert better

* You will manage community

* You will find ways to increase traction, analyze cohorts - be on top of Mixpanel

### Your profile

* Your methods are driven by product and inspired by data

* You can write code

* You can write blog posts

* You can say "fuck this shit" in public ([see Zed Shaw - he's awesome](https://vimeo.com/43380467))

* You can look beyond adwords or SEO 

* You know why we exist, craft viral strategies easy

* You are ethical, you don't make fake twitter followers, nor increase user counts just to make yourself look better

* You can fire yourself if you are not performing well

* You know who know Noah Kagan, Andrew Chen are, you can do what they did

## Ok, sound good?

This job is not for everyone, if you don't hear from me it's because I get a lot of emails, and  saying "Sorry" shouldn't be necessary

However, if you do want to hear back, tell me,

* One or two ideas that convinces me that you can deliver

* If you have done this before, let me know what you did

Short emails work the best. Your links should tell your story, not your email.
